What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was unclear about resolving conflicts between branchs and master repos. This was the area I had the most challenges with prior to this session. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Merge conflict error handling was clarified for me. Now I have a much better grasp of how this works.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I had several questions related to specific code commands, how merge conflicts are resolved, and what makes good commit messages.  

What still confuses you about Git?
The extent of how merge conflicts are identified. Is it limited to code on the same line or are there other ways in which conflicts are detected?

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was very successful. I was intimidated at first, but found that it was very comfortable and helped me understand the material very well.
